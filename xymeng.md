# Xiangyi Meng 
Student, Programmer, Primary Researcher<img width="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xymeng16/xymeng16.github.io/master/_medias/img/xymeng.jpg">  




## Overview

I am currently a undergraduate student in Department of Computer Science at Xiamen University since 2014. 
My hometown is Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. My research mainly focuses on Data Mining, Bioinformatics and 
Security. My current interests are in graph mining, human action recognition and semi-supervised learning.
And I am preparing to study in Hong Kong after graduating from XMU.

## Researches

<!-- A list is also available [online](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=LTOTl0YAAAAJ) -->

### A keyword-based auto generating system for Chinese couplets  
_Advisor: Prof. Xuling Zheng_
- Novelly expand the current method for couplets generating based on a given sentence to an approach using given
  keyword.
- A phrase-based SMT model is deployed to generate the initial couplet pairs and an approach for optimizing the
  quality of the couplets based on immune algorithm is proposed.
- An SVM is trained for the evaluation of the couplets using manually pre-labeled couplets.

### A basketball shooting training and motion tracking system via machine learning
_Advisor: Lingxiang Zheng, Senior Engineer_
- A neural network embedded on Intel Curie is applied for the evaluation of the shooting performance using
  features extracted from accelerometer and gyrometer data.
- Inspired by Robotics, we constrained the possible location of the joints in the arm into certain spaces represented
  as point-clouds, aiming at simulating the shooting motion.
- A modified hidden Markov Model is proposed to track the motion of shooting, which its states are defined in the
  spaces of the point-clouds.
  
### Iteratively collective prediction of disease-gene associations through the incomplete network
_Advisor: Prof. Xiangxiang Zeng_
- We studied the similarity measure of the nodes in heterogeneous network and came up with “weighted path count
  with random walk” to fit the complex topological architecture.
- PU learning is studied and integrated into the classification method in view of negative samples in gene-disease
  link datasets are extremely scarce.
- Being different with state-of-the-art singleton approach, an iterative framework for link prediction on
  heterogeneous network is proposed and deployed on gene-disease link prediction.
- The source code is published at my GitHub:[xymeng16/ISL4LP](https://github.com/xymeng16/ISL4LP).
  
### A Django based online Q&A system
_[Xiamen University Turing Class Online System](http://turing.ymyin.me/)_
- Inspired by [Stackoverflow.com](Stackoverflow.com), we developed an similar online QA website based on the Django framework to
  provide a platform for the teachers and students at XMU to communicate with each other.
- Currently, our project is still being developing, and it has 4 basic functions: User Control, Q&A, Online Test, File
  Upload&Download.
- Our project is deployed on a Ubuntu server at Ali Cloud using uWSGI and Nginx.
